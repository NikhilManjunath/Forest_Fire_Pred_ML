Prediction of Forest Fires Using Machine Learning
- Welcome to the Machine Learning project folder. This folder contains all the necessary files and instructions to predict the possibility of a forest fire based on meteorological data.

The folder contains the following files:
- Data Folder : contains the Training and Testing Data
- utils.py and confusion_matrix.py : python files containing helper functions for the Machine Learning models
- requirements.txt : file containing requriements to run the code smoothly
- main.py : main python file to run the Machine Learning model predictions

Getting Started:
1. Requirements
	- Ensure Python version 3.9.7 is running on the system.
	- The requirements.txt file contains the necessary python libraries required to successfully run the project. 
	- To install dependencies, run the following command on the terminal:
